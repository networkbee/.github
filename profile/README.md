## 🛠️ Core Servers

These are the heart of our infrastructure — each playing a vital role in keeping our world alive and thriving.

| 🐝 Server | 🧠 Description |
|----------|----------------|
| **🌼 Bee** *(Main Minecraft Server)* | The core Minecraft experience — where players gather, build, and play. |
| **🕸️ Hive** *(Main Proxy Server)* | Our traffic controller — routes players across different parts of the network. |
| **👑 Queen** *(Main API Service)* | The command center — handles player data, stats, and integrations behind the scenes. |
